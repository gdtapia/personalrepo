### **Developer Certificate of Origin - DCO**

 This is a security layer for the project and for the developers. It is mandatory.
 
Follow one of these two methods to add DCO to your commits:
 
**1. Command line**
 Follow the steps: 
 **Step 1:** Configure your local git environment adding the same name and e-mail configured at your GitHub account. It helps to sign commits manually during reviews and suggestions.

 ```
git config --global user.name “Name”
git config --global user.email “email@domain.com.br”
```
**Step 2:** Add the Signed-off-by line with the `'-s'` flag in the git commit command:

```
$ git commit -s -m "This is my commit message"
```
**2. GitHub website**

You can also manually sign your commits during GitHub reviews and suggestions, follow the steps below: 

**Step 1:** When the commit changes box opens, manually type or paste your signature in the comment box, see the example:

```
Signed-off-by: Name < e-mail address >
```

For this method, your name and e-mail must be the same registered on your GitHub account.
